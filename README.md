# GitBash For Noobs

My main purpose of making this repo is for others to be able to use GitBash for Github.
As well as I learn how to use GitBash more I will put what I learn on here and essentially use this as my point of reference.
I will put it in simple terms and make it as clear as possible so that anyone even a complete noob can use it.
Presuming you already have GitBash. 

I will add more to this.
